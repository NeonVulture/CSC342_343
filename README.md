### *Self Check Labs* 
These self check labs are solely for testing your understanding of digital circuits, VHDL programming, and simulations.   
- SCL 1: Multiplexers
- SCL 2: Decoders & Demultiplexers
- SCL 3: Full Adder
- SCL 4: D-Latch, D Flip-Flop, and Registers
- SCL 5: Multiplication & Division 

### *Labs*
Graded labs that will eventually be utilized in the final lab whose task is to build a Single Cycle MIPS Processor CPU.
- Lab 1: Arithmetic Logic Unit
- Midterm Lab: Memory Modules & Adder/Subtractor Unit
- Lab 2: Branching
- Final Lab: Single Cycle MIPS Processor CPU 

### *Quizzes*
In class quizzes on Computer Organization topics covered in CSC342.
- Prerequisite Quiz: Review of CSC210, CSC211, and EE210 material 
- Quiz 1: Number Representions, Floating & Fixed Point Representations, and Arithmetic
